<div class="calibre12"><span><span><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold1">T</span></span></span>he purpose of this book is to teach you the fundamentals of Java programming. It uses a step-by-step approach complete with numerous examples, self tests, and projects. It assumes no previous programming experience. The book starts with the basics, such as how to compile and run a Java program. It then discusses the keywords, features, and constructs that form the core of the Java language. You’ll also find coverage of some of Java’s most advanced features, including multithreaded programming and generics. An introduction to the fundamentals of Swing and JavaFX concludes the book. By the time you finish, you will have a firm grasp of the essentials of Java programming.</span></div>
<div class="calibre23"><span>It is important to state at the outset that this book is just a starting point. Java is more than just the elements that define the language. Java also includes extensive libraries and tools that aid in the development of programs. To be a top-notch Java programmer implies mastery of these areas, too. After completing this book, you will have the knowledge to pursue any and all other aspects of Java.</span></div>
<div class="calibre1"><span class="calibre10"><span><span class="bold1">The Evolution of Java</span></span></span></div>
<div class="calibre12"><span>Only a few languages have fundamentally reshaped the very essence of programming. In this elite group, one stands out because its impact was both rapid and widespread. This language is, of course, Java. It is not an overstatement to say that the original release of Java 1.0 in 1995 by Sun Microsystems, Inc., caused a revolution in programming. This revolution radically transformed the Web into a highly interactive environment. In the process, Java set a new standard in computer language design.</span></div>
<div class="calibre23"><span>Over the years, Java has continued to grow, evolve, and otherwise redefine itself. Unlike many other languages, which are slow to incorporate new features, Java has often been at the forefront of computer language development. One reason for this is the culture of innovation and change that came to surround Java. As a result, Java has gone through several upgrades—some relatively small, others more significant.</span></div>
<div class="calibre23"><span>The first major update to Java was version 1.1. The features added by Java 1.1 were more substantial than the increase in the minor revision number would have you think. For example, Java 1.1 added many new library elements, redefined the way events are handled, and reconfigured many features of the original 1.0 library.</span></div>
<div class="calibre23"><span>The next major release of Java was Java 2, where the 2 indicates “second generation.” The creation of Java 2 was a watershed event, marking the beginning of Java’s “modern age.” The first release of Java 2 carried the version number 1.2. It may seem odd that the first release of Java 2 used the 1.2 version number. The reason is that it originally referred to the internal version number of the Java libraries but then was generalized to refer to the entire release, itself. With Java 2, Sun repackaged the Java product as J2SE (Java 2 Platform Standard Edition), and the version numbers began to be applied to that product.</span></div>
<div class="calibre23"><span>The next upgrade of Java was J2SE 1.3. This version of Java was the first major upgrade to the original Java 2 release. For the most part, it added to existing functionality and “tightened up” the development environment. The release of J2SE 1.4 further enhanced Java. This release contained several important new features, including chained exceptions, channel-based I/O, and the <span class="bold1">assert</span> keyword.</span></div>
<div class="calibre23"><span>The release of J2SE 5 created nothing short of a second Java revolution. Unlike most of the previous Java upgrades, which offered important but incremental improvements, J2SE 5 fundamentally expanded the scope, power, and range of the language. To give you an idea of the magnitude of the changes caused by J2SE 5, here is a list of its major new features:</span></div>
<div class="calibre24"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00002.jpg" class="calibre25"/>   Generics</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00002.jpg" class="calibre25"/>   Autoboxing/unboxing</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00002.jpg" class="calibre25"/>   Enumerations</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00002.jpg" class="calibre25"/>   The enhanced “for-each” style <span class="bold1">for</span> loop</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00002.jpg" class="calibre25"/>   Variable-length arguments (varargs)</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00002.jpg" class="calibre25"/>   Static import</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00002.jpg" class="calibre25"/>   Annotations</span></div>
<div class="calibre27"><span>This is not a list of minor tweaks or incremental upgrades. Each item in the list represents a significant addition to the Java language. Some, such as generics, the enhanced <span class="bold1">for</span> loop, and varargs, introduced new syntax elements. Others, such as autoboxing and auto-unboxing, altered the semantics of the language. Annotations added an entirely new dimension to programming.</span></div>
<div class="calibre23"><span>The importance of these new features is reflected in the use of the version number “5.” The next version number for Java would normally have been 1.5. However, the new features were so significant that a shift from 1.4 to 1.5 just didn’t seem to express the magnitude of the change. Instead, Sun elected to increase the version number to 5 as a way of emphasizing that a major event was taking place. Thus, it was named J2SE 5, and the Java Development Kit (JDK) was called JDK 5. In order to maintain consistency, however, Sun decided to use 1.5 as its <span class="italic">internal version</span> number, which is also referred to as the <span class="italic">developer version</span> number. The “5” in J2SE 5 is called the <span class="italic">product version</span> number.</span></div>
<div class="calibre23"><span>The next release of Java was called Java SE 6, and Sun once again decided to change the name of the Java platform. First, notice that the “2” has been dropped. Thus, the platform now had the name <span class="italic">Java SE</span>, and the official product name was <span class="italic">Java Platform, Standard Edition 6</span>, with the development kit being called JDK 6. As with J2SE 5, the 6 in Java SE 6 is the product version number. The internal, developer version number is 1.6.</span></div>
<div class="calibre23"><span>Java SE 6 built on the base of J2SE 5, adding incremental improvements. Java SE 6 added no major features to the Java language proper, but it did enhance the API libraries, added several new packages, and offered improvements to the run time. It also went through several updates during its long (in Java terms) life cycle, with several upgrades added along the way. In general, Java SE 6 served to further solidify the advances made by J2SE 5.</span></div>
<div class="calibre23"><span>The next release of Java was called Java SE 7, with the development kit being called JDK 7. It has an internal version number of 1.7. Java SE 7 was the first major release of Java after Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle. Java SE 7 added several new features, including significant additions to the language and the API libraries. Some of the most important features added by Java SE 7 were those developed as part of <span class="italic">Project Coin</span>. The purpose of Project Coin was to identify a number of small changes to the Java language that would be incorporated into JDK 7, including</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00002.jpg" class="calibre25"/>   A <span class="bold1">String</span> can control a <span class="bold1">switch</span> statement.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00002.jpg" class="calibre25"/>   Binary integer literals.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00002.jpg" class="calibre25"/>   Underscores in numeric literals.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00002.jpg" class="calibre25"/>   An expanded <span class="bold1">try</span> statement, called <span class="bold1">try</span><span class="italic">-with-resources</span>, that supports automatic resource management.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00002.jpg" class="calibre25"/>   Type inference (via the <span class="italic">diamond</span> operator) when constructing a generic instance.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00002.jpg" class="calibre25"/>   Enhanced exception handling in which two or more exceptions can be caught by a single <span class="bold1">catch</span> (multicatch) and better type checking for exceptions that are rethrown.</span></div>
<div class="calibre27"><span>As you can see, even though the Project Coin features were considered to be small changes to the language, their benefits were much larger than the qualifier “small” would suggest. In particular, the <span class="bold1">try</span>-with-resources statement profoundly affects the way that a substantial amount of code is written.</span></div>
<div class="calibre1"><span class="calibre10"><span><span class="bold1">Java SE 8</span></span></span></div>
<div class="calibre12"><span>The newest release of Java is Java SE 8, with the development kit being called JDK 8. It has an internal version number of 1.8. JDK 8 represents a very significant upgrade to the Java language because of the inclusion of a far-reaching new language feature: the <span class="italic">lambda expression</span>. The impact of lambda expressions will be profound, changing both the way that programming solutions are conceptualized and how Java code is written. In the process, lambda expressions can simplify and reduce the amount of source code needed to create certain constructs. The addition of lambda expressions also causes a new operator (the <span class="bold1">–&gt;</span>) and a new syntax element to be added to the language. Lambda expressions help ensure that Java will remain the vibrant, nimble language that users have come to expect.</span></div>
<div class="calibre23"><span>In addition to lambda expressions, JDK 8 adds many other important new features. For example, beginning with JDK 8, it is now possible to define a default implementation for a method specified by an interface. JDK 8 also bundles support for JavaFX, Java’s new GUI framework. JavaFX is expected to soon play an important part in nearly all Java applications, ultimately replacing Swing for most GUI-based projects. In the final analysis, Java SE 8 is a major release that profoundly expands the capabilities of the language and changes the way that Java code is written. Its effects will be felt throughout the Java universe and for years to come. The material in this book has been updated to reflect Java SE 8, with many new features, updates, and additions indicated throughout.</span></div>
